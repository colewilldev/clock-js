This was a really fun project for me, I have always loved the variety of different styles that you see on the faces of watches growing up, as well as seeing a row of clocks at the airport that showcase different timezones across the world.  So I decided to combine both concepts, highly varied styles between each clock as well as 4 different timezones, and a digital diplay for each.

It was a little tricky computing the right time across all 4 clocks given that the getDate() function in JS returns Militarty time (1-24hrs).  So I had to program for that, as well as to be able to pass in a time zone and amount of time offset into both of my clock functions.

The hardest part by far was replacing the Miami clock's hands with the Flamingo legs.  It took way longer than I would have wanted but I had this vision in my mind of a flamingo clock with the legs as the hands, so I'm really happy I took the time to get the css right...

Anyways, Hope you enjoy them as much as I do and thanks for stopping by!
