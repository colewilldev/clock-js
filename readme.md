# Here Are Some Clocks I Made

This was a really fun project for me, I have always loved the different styles on the faces of watches growing up, as well as seeing a row of clocks at the airport that showcase different timezones across the world.  So I combined both of the two concepts, with a different style for each city/timezone.
